### honey_wasp server

thought about it and i don't want to make a wysiwyg gui builder--kind of inclined to believe that primary interface should be through the code in a numerically creative compositional mindset; however, not only can we provision on-screen interface dials for certain things, we can ad-hoc keyboard combo interfaces to those interfaces, and we can save config data to persistent layer using redis and websocket server, and maybe other kinds of files, just using fs utils..  so, necessarily something with similar functionality to dashku.

for now making a simple node server which will have some various websocket implementations and wrappers (using opportunity to play with and learn some tools in a new context), and persist to redis.
