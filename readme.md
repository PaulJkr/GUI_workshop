##### GUI_workshop

An environment for design and development of UI/UX components in React, using Webpack for reloading.

Right now it's pretty chaotic with no navigation--just it goes to whatever I'm working  on at the time.  This will change.  For now I'm just prototyping a bunch of stuff; will organise it later.

###### to run it:

`$ webpack-dev-server --hot`, localhost:8080/gui_workshop.html

Only tested in Firefox, and I know one part at least that uses feature (`Object.assign()`) from ES-6 which as of now (June 15, 2015) Chromium doesn't support.
