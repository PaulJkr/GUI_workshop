I'm doing a deep refactor of this project now, basically rewriting it from scratch.

Instead of meddling with this repo, I've set the refactor to a new repo at [Terebinth/Vickers](https://github.com/Terebinth/Vickers).

For the most part the content from this repo won't be migrated, and in the near-future this one likely will be back to forefront of active development, but for now active GUI_workshop development will be at Vickers.

###### GUI_workshop




you will need to make React available in node_modules; i do this with a clone, you may add it to package.json.



`webpack-dev-server --hot`
